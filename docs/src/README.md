README for Sphinx Documentation
===============================

Install Sphinx
--------------

Python should be installed on build m/c.
List of commands to install required python packages.

  ```
   $ pipx install sphinx
   $ pipx install breathe
   $ pipx install rocm-docs-core
   $ pipx inject sphinx breathe rocm-docs-core
  ```

Notes:
  1. Breathe is a plugin used for doxygen generated xml to be used under sphinx.
  2. Few important links,
       https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html
       https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html


Important Files
---------------

  ***Doxyfile.in***

  This file contains all configuration needed to customize doxygen input and output behavior.


  ***conf.py.in***

  This file contains all configuration needed to customize sphinx input and output behavior.


  ***index.rst***

  This file acts as main page of documentation.


Build sphinx Documents
----------------------

Commands to build LibM documentation,

 ```
  $ cd <path_to_project_directory>
  $ cmake --preset dev-release-gcc -DLIBM_BUILD_DOCS=ON --fresh
  $ cmake --build --preset dev-release-gcc --target libmdoc
 ```

- Build directory contains all the html pages generated by sphinx under path,
  `<build>/docs/src`.
- Final html pages can be found under `<build>/aocl_docs` directory.
- Open `<build>/aocl_docs/html/index.html` using browser.


reStructuredText
----------------

| reStructuredText is also referred as reST.
| Refer Primer available on sphinx website for more information about reST.
| Few examples on reST follows.

### Paragraphs

All lines of same paragraph must be left-aligned to the same level of indentation.

### Lists and Quote-like blocks

  * This is a bulleted list.

  1. This is a numbered list.
  2. It has two items too.

  #. This is a numbered list.
  #. Numbered list has 2-lines.


### Images

  .. image:: picture.png

  .. image:: picture.jpeg
     :height: 100px
     :width: 200 px
     :scale: 50 %
     :alt: alternate text
     :align: right


### Mathematical Expressions

  :math:

  Used for equations like below,
    :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

  This displays like, a2 + b2 = c2


### Code snnipet

  .. code-block:: language
     code

  .. include:: my_code_example.txt

  .. literalinclude:: configuration.json
    :language: JSON


### Table

  1. Grid
  +------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
  | Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
  | (header rows optional) |            |          |          |
  +========================+============+==========+==========+
  | body row 1, column 1   | column 2   | column 3 | column 4 |
  +------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
  | body row 2             | Cells may span columns.          |
  +------------------------+------------+---------------------+
  | body row 3             | Cells may  | - Table cells       |
  +------------------------+ span rows. | - contain           |
  | body row 4             |            | - body elements.    |
  +------------------------+------------+---------------------+

  2. Simple
  =====  =====  =======
    A      B     A & B
  =====  =====  =======
  False  False  False
  True   False  False
  False  True   False
  True   True   True
  =====  =====  =======


### Sections

  ####
  Part
  ####

  *********
  Chapter
  *********

  Section
  =======
  Subsection
  ----------
  Subsubsection
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Paragraph
  """""""""

  # with overline, for parts
  * with overline, for chapters
  = for sections
  - for subsections
  ^ for subsubsections
  " for paragraphs


### Hyperlinks

  For inline web link use  `Link text <https://domain/>`_

  This is a paragraph that contains `a link`_.
    .. _a link: https://domain/


### Cross-referencing

  .. _my-reference-label:

  Section to cross-reference
  --------------------------

  :ref:`my-reference-label`  refers to the section itself.

  The :ref: role generates a link to the section, with the link title as
  “Section to cross-reference”.
  This works well even if section and reference are in different source files.
